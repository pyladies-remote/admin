# Youtube Live

We provide teachers with use a PyLadies Remote google account
for teaching classes.
This is especially helpful because it means all our videos will
be archived in one place.

# Gaining Access to the account

1. Please make sure you have a free lastpass account
   and provide the organizer you're working with the
   email associated with that account.

1. A few weeks before your class, an organizer will
   securely share a temporary password (for your class only)
   for the webcasting google account.
   As soon as you receive the password, please make sure you
   can access the account.
